				<p>Robert Kirk has a bachelor's degree in Anthropology specializing in cultural studies, but the curricullum focuses on all three main subjects: cultural, physical and archaeology. He has a love for understanding people and cultures. Thus he lived and worked in Japan for INTERAC.ltd. Feeling home sick he returned home from Japan after two and a half years abroad. Upon his return to the States he began to search for a new career path.
				</p>
				<p>
				He then came upon the idea of learning to code. His first experiences with coding involved making a small mod (modification) to one of his favorite games, Victoria 2. The mod made a single event that turns Ukraine into a democratic country. This event is availble as long as Ukraine is independent of Russia. The event was made to simulate the old Cossack Republic. It had once existed before their subjugation by Muscovite princes. The mod had some glitches. 
				</p>
				<!--List of glitches-->
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li>
					The 'decision' did not disapear from the list of decisions after firing
					</li>
					<li>
					Cavalry stat modifiers did not activate
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<br>
				<p>
				The errors occured due to the lack of experience that Robert had with coding. He did not realize that he needed to create proper "flags". Proper flags would have caused fire once, cause the decision to disapear from the list and for the modifiers to take hold.
